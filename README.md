# CPTtools:  Tools for Creating Conditional Probability Tables

Provides support parameterized tables for Bayesian networks, particularly the IRT-like DiBello tables. 
Also, provides some tools for visualing the networks.


Many of the algorithms in the package are documented in 

Almond, Mislevy, Steinberg, Yan and Williamson (1995).  _Bayesian Networks in Educational Assessment._  Springer.
